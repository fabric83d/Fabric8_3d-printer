# Fabric8_3d-printer

A 3D Printer designed by Andrew Bell 

The design is inspired by the original printrbot, with all parts baring extruder and Z couplers designed for this printer. The cad design for parts was done in Autodesk Inventor and Solid Works.


The goal of this printer was to produce a high quality, reliable printer, at a reasonable cost. 

The print head of the machine was designed to be quickly interchangeable, for either maintenance or an alternative print head, such as a paste extruder.
